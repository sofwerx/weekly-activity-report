- Fw: laptops [SWXIT-92](https://jira.supermicro0.opswerx.org/browse/SWXIT-92)* - Still working on, just waiting to hear back from Candy

### Objective

- Get ready for Austin's send off, which means absorbing as much information as I can from him before he goes off into the real world!
- Become more comfortable with software associated with work - JIRA specifically.
- Work on first JIRA tickets

### Work I Did

- Became super comfortable with using Clonezilla, am now able to maneuver throughout Clonezilla through and through - both with creating an image as well as using an image
- Understood Clonezilla on the software side -- ran into a laptop that did not have a Network card and wasn't able to boot Clonezilla using PXE boot
- Helped cable management during power outage in city
- Took a crash course on Snipe-IT and basic Linux commands by Austin


### Meetings
  - Crash course on Linux commands (Austin and Marcus for about 1 hour)

### Summary/Remarks:

- Ran through procedure with Clonezilla and what to do if troubleshoot is needed/if Clonezilla closes and how to reboot (e.g. in the case that it wasn't unmounted correctly in power surge)

- Learned more tips and tricks about cable management including how to work around tiny desk spaces and how to maximize aesthetic and penmanship (Head Shed desks are now under control)

- Getting more comfortable within JIRA


### Follow up

- Find better time management between normal, daily work affairs and working on projects such as JIRA tickets (need to dedicate more time to research)

- Will continue to work within JIRA and aim to resolve at least the same number of tickets if not more within the next week

- Will start revamping the closet now that the storage bins are at the facility with Marcus starting on Monday
