### Big Three

- Revaluated lag testing without the limiters

- Organized a lag testing method for the whole system

- Meet with Mujahid and discussed current work and guidance on the next steps

### Objective

Create block diagram of total system lag.

### Work I Did

Completed all system lag testing with optimized controller.


### Meetings

  - Mujahid gave Jesse and I a rundown on how to do a bode plot and do a frequency sweep using Arduino


### Summary/Remarks:

- The total system lag using with a moving target is much larger than system lag evaluated at the component level; meaning close loop response, for unknown reasons, is twice as long as open loop response
- Will need to retest one more time with the IMU on the same board as the control unit
- Research bode plot response using cipher on data taken from serial print data in excel


### Follow up

- Begin to format old test data into a formal document not only for Mujahid, but for presentation of internship experience
