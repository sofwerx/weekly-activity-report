### Big Three

- Diagnosed two major speed limiters in the code

- Organized method to test the scope lag

- Updated MOVI firmware

### Objective

Create block diagram of total system lag.

### Work I Did

Assessed where the majority of the lag is coming from. 200ms of lag from the scope appears to be the largest.


### Meetings

  - N/A


### Summary/Remarks:

- MOVI firmware is much more responsive
- Scope delays with impulse response are not the same as the refresh rate
- Eliminating the two speed limiters allowed for the Arduino to operate with 1-5ms loop time  


### Follow up

- Diagnose MOVI delay with similar method used for scope delay
