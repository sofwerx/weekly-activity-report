### Big Three

- Attempted to run both IMU and controller on same microcontroller

- Began to plot data from flight logs

- Worked on PizzaKucha slides

### Objective

Finish system modelling of drone 'Plant'.

### Work I Did

Created dropped down resistor circuit for both I2C lines, scope and IMU, and after wiring up to Arduino found that the Arduino cannot function as a master for the IMU at the same time it is a slave to the Tracking Point scope. When importing flight log data into MATLAB, a key had to be searched to understand what all the variables represent in the workspace. Once the key was found the data was then filtered for desired information.


### Meetings

  - Weekly Standup


### Summary/Remarks:

-I2C is capable of multi-master networking, but having a device act as both a master and slave concurrently requires using interrupts and being able to demux the information back into its correct format, thus for scope of project was not worth the investment to engineer
- Mission Planner is a great tool to take .bin files from the scope and directly convert them into MATLAB files, although reading them requires a key for what the labels represent  


### Follow up

- Use FFT on data from flight logs to create a frequency response of the drone 'Plant'
