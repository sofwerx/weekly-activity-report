### Big Three

- Presented PizzaKucha

- Correctly sized the buffer to have the IMU data be readable on controller board

- Started FFT on gyro angular data

### Objective

Do FFT on gyro data from flight data to see critical frequencies of the system

### Work I Did

Have the IMU data be readable on the controller board (MEGA)


### Meetings

  - Met with Mujahid to go over PizzaKucha slides


### Summary/Remarks:

- The 'String' type did not work on the data from the IMU, caused random numbers not the 'ypr'; instead the 'char' type was used and this was then created into an array which was then sized into a buffer of len==24. Other parsing techniques were attempted, but having the 'ypr' serial print on a single line from the UNO side, and then creating a buffer to match the exact size of a sample ended up being the easiest method to get readable data.

### Follow up

- Continue to format FFT, currently its hard to see what frequencies are dominant
