### Big Three

- Participated in Demo for Ballistics Smart Rail

- Retuned gains for hovering drone

- Met with Space Coast Unmanned to discuss flight procedures

### Objective

Construct demo procedure and test moving targets with newly optimized code.

### Work I Did

Helped set up flight demo and controlled the Ballistic Smart Rail. Researched POCs for CWMD problem statements.


### Meetings

  - Mujahid discussed his goals for demoing the project
  - Matt from Space Coast Unmanned explained how to test the flying demo and explained basic flying procedures


### Summary/Remarks:

- It was hard having tuned to fix targets and then adapting to the flying dynamics provided by the drone
- The controller still needs work on manual controls; perhaps figuring out the pressing and holding button for movement could fix this issue
- The Kp and Ki components appeared to track well once the targets were tagged
- The small movements on the drone would show a large shift in the scope vision. These large drifts due to flying would cause the target to become lost; perhaps more distant targets could help this issue


### Follow up

- Meet with Mujahid to discus further direction of the project
