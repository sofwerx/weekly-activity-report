### Big Three

- Received guidance for integral control from Mujahid

- Established two major errors in the controller

- Retuned controller without print statements

### Objective

Continue to test the integral controller.

### Work I Did

Found errors in the controller and solved the jerk in the negative x axis.


### Meetings

  - Mujahid gave me guidance on how print statements could alter the performance and explained a new way to implement the integral portion of the controller


### Summary/Remarks:

- The print statements not only cause the signal to lose tracking, but it also would tilt in the negative y axis and cause loss of gimbal control
- The integral portion of the controller was defined with an error2 variable and this would be zero when printed not the actual value of the integral, therefore it was removed and the control signal took directly the integral variable
- Kp has been successfully retuned without print statements going to serial output
- Ki still needs tuning as moving target causes instability


### Follow up

- Ask Mujahid for further guidance on how to help Ki track moving targets
